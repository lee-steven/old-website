    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Ever since taking my first computer science class at University, I have fallen in love
    with programming. I hope to learn more and sharpen my skills so that in the future I can combine
    my interests: programming and fine art.
    </p>
    
    <p>In my free time I like to draw/paint, sing, dance, and travel. 
    </p>
    <p>One of my many goals in life is to learn to speak at least four languages fluently. 
    Right now, I can speak English and Korean fluently and I am currently studying Chinese 
    language. I hope to learn Spanish as my fourth.
